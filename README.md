## About
The goal of this project is to create the function `get_next_line.c` which, when called in a loop, will read one line at a time in the file descriptor, until the end of the file. As stated in the subject, the program must compile with the `flag-D BUFFER_SIZE=` which will be used as the buffer size for the `read` calls in `get_next_line()`. You can find more details in [the subject of the project](https://github.com/PublioElio/School-42-Get_Next_Line/blob/main/get_next_line.es.subject.pdf).

## Testing
This function have been tested with [Francinette](https://github.com/xicodomingues/francinette).
